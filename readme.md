## Overview

 Python script for image processing and manipulation using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Allows you to apply various image processing techniques on a sample image.

## Features

- **Image Loading:** Loaded sample images from Python libraries
- **Basic Manipulations:** Applied Gaussian blur, rotation, and other basic image manipulations.
- **Visualization:** Visualized the original and manipulated images using Matplotlib.
- **Thresholding:** Converted images to binary using thresholding techniques.
- **Numpy Operations:** Utilized NumPy for image arithmetic, histogram equalization, cropping, resizing + more.

## Requirements

- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

- Choose a sample image or provide your own.
- You can experiment with various image processing operations by tweaking the code - `im.py`.
